# Vibrational Field Dynamics (VFD) – Short Symbolic Review

This repository contains a **public, symbolic-only overview** of **Vibrational Field Dynamics (VFD)** – a geometric substrate model intended to describe coherence phenomena across physics, biology, and cognition.

The focus here is **conceptual and non-disclosive**: all generative mathematics, internal operators, and proprietary mechanisms are intentionally omitted. The goal is to provide an accessible entry point for researchers exploring geometry-based models of synchrony and invariants.

## Repository Contents

- `latex/vfd_ssr_v0.2.tex`  
  LaTeX source for the **VFD Short Symbolic Review (SSR)**.

- `pdf/vfd_ssr_v0.2.pdf`  
  Compiled PDF of the SSR for quick reading.

- `figures/` *(optional)*  
  Placeholder for safe, symbolic diagrams (e.g. φ-scaled shells, geometric substrate schematics).

## What is VFD (at the symbolic level)?

Vibrational Field Dynamics (VFD) models:

- a **geometric substrate** rather than empty space,
- **φ-scaled shells** as regions of stable standing-wave recurrence,
- **torsional intervals** as symbolic “distances” within a recursive lattice,
- **stable identities** (particles, molecular modes, neural oscillations, agents) as **recurrent vibrational patterns** in this substrate.

This repository only discusses these ideas **symbolically**. No explicit equations, algorithms, or derivations are included here.

## Intended Audience

This short review is written for researchers working in areas such as:

- geometric / network models of **interbrain coherence** and neural synchrony,  
- **wave- and geometry-based** interpretations of molecular dynamics,  
- **shape-based attractors** in systems neuroscience and morphogenesis,  
- cross-scale models of coherence, agency, and information flow.

If you are already exploring geometric invariants in neural or biological systems, the SSR is meant to provide a compact conceptual bridge to the VFD substrate picture.

## How to Use This Repo

1. **Quick read**  
   Download or open `pdf/vfd_ssr_v0.2.pdf` for a 3–5 page conceptual overview.

2. **LaTeX / Overleaf**  
   Use `latex/vfd_ssr_v0.2.tex` if you’d like to inspect or adapt the LaTeX source.

3. **Figures**  
   Any symbolic figures (φ-scaled shells, torsional intervals, etc.) will be added under `figures/` as the public-safe visual layer evolves.

## Scope and Limitations

This repository deliberately does **not** contain:

- generative mathematical operators or full formalism,  
- derivations of physical constants or particle structures,  
- substrate dynamics or simulation code,  
- implementation details related to AI or hardware.

Those live in separate, non-public or more technical projects.  
The SSR is meant only as a **first-contact conceptual document**.
